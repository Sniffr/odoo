## Development Steps

### Phase 1: Basic Module Setup
1. **Create module structure** - Set up directories and basic files
2. **Create manifest file** - Define module metadata and dependencies
3. **Set up init files** - Initialize the module and its components

### Phase 2: Data Models
1. **Staff Member Model** - Extend res.partner to add bookable flag
2. **Appointment Model** - Create appointment records with relationships

### Phase 5: Security & Access Control

2. **Public Access** - Allow customers to view staff without login

### Phase 6: Demo Data & Testing
1. **Sample Staff** - Create demo staff members
2. **Test Data** - Sample appointments for testing
3. **Module Installation** - Deploy and test functionality
